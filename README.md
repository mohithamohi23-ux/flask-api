# flask-api

**📌 Features**

The API supports the following operations:

✔ POST /users

Create a new user and store it in an in-memory dictionary.

✔ GET /users

Retrieve all users currently stored.

✔ PUT /users/<id>

Update an existing user's information.

✔ DELETE /users/<id>

Delete a user by ID.
